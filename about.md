Hi! I am a junior Data Scientist at AhaMove, an on-demand logistics company in Vietnam.

Since I'm trying to be a Machine Learning researcher, I'm trying to get into a graduate school for MSc in Data Science or Computer Science or Statistics. I've just recently graduated from Hanoi University of Science and Technology, majoring Automatic Control. I was a student in Talented Engineer Program.

## Research Interest

Currently, my plan for my future reseach orientation is Natural Language Processing (NLP). But at the moment, I'm strengthening my Mathematics Skill as my quest rightnow is Michael Spivak's Calculus.
