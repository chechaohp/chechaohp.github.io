I try to learn math for Machine Learning based on [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/ggpzk2/a_comprehensive_selfstudy_guide_for_the_math/) from Reddit.

- [x] How to Prove It - Velleman
- [o] Understanding Analysis -  Stephen Abbott (working on, will write a solution myself in latex)

This semester is quite heavy for me, I might not finish this book soon.
