I try to learn math for Machine Learning based on [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/ggpzk2/a_comprehensive_selfstudy_guide_for_the_math/) from Reddit.

- [x] How to Prove It - Velleman
- [x] Understanding Analysis - Stephen Abbott
- [x] Linear Algebra Done Right - Sheldon Axler (this book is a treat for anyone who have learned Linear Algebra, I haven't completely finished it but will continue to read when having free time)
- [ ] Introduction to Mathematical Statistics -  Robert Hogg, Joseph McKean, Allen Craig
- [ ] Convex Optimization - Stephen Boyd - [EE364a](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee364a/index.html)
