I love video game. My first time touching a keyboard was about 15 years ago. And with the help of the kids in my neighborhood, I got a chance to play many video games. Soon after that, video games became my cup of tea. As my generation grew up, we went through many form of video games. I don't know much about the others but in my community, I have gone through the acarde era (game with coins) and then console era (PS1) and offline PC game era (_the Sim 1_, _Samurai Showdown 1/2/3/4_,...) and online game era (_MU_, _Gunbound_, _Audition_, _Boom online_,...). After all these eras, offline game is something that is really special for me. As I'm always fond of the story behind, I'm always seeking for a game which have a great story instead of great gameplay like many others.

When I was in 8 or 9th grade which was about 9 or 10 years ago, I was hungry for a game, but my parents didn't want to upgrade my PC (RAM: 128MB, CPU pen III with 2MB of graphics inside) since they were scared that I would have play video games more and stop studying. I had to find a way to play video games as I love it. I had come to a decision that I would create my own game if no body give me a chance to play video games.

And that's how RMXP came to my life. After that, I realized that there were many more Vietnamese indie games that were created by RMXP like **The Legend of Langbian I & II** or **Nam Quốc Sơn Hà**. I had my own project called **Đất Nước Đứng Lên - Khởi Nghĩa Lam Sơn** with an ambition of helping young children in Vietnam have a better understanding of Vietnamese history. I was really passtionate about it.

More than 2 years had gone, in October of 2011 I droped this project, published all the source code that I had written in that 2 years. Life happenned and Up until now, I couldn't find a way back into making game. But I had learn many things from that time such as UX testing (our community regularly gave feedback for each other's projects), coding logic (my first programming language was Ruby), detail oriented,... Now, everything was deleted. I just found out some images from that project still remain on my old photobucket account (show below)

__*Please do not blame me for the graphics that I used for this project. I was around 14 years old and found these images on some online forums. I didn't understand about the copyright at the time. Everything is deleted now. I also didn't have any intention selling my game. Thanks for understanding.*__
